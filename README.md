You can also set up a scheduled command to automate this.

## Logging Health Checks

Health check results are logged in the database. You can view logs by visiting:

This will display all the health check logs for monitoring and debugging.

## Notifications

Set up notifications to get alerted when a health check fails. Notifications can be configured in the `HealthCheckNotification` class.

## Middleware

Route::middleware('health.check')->group(function () {
    // Your routes
});
```
